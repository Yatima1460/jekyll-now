Many thanks to Nicol Bolas for his amazing story on StackExchange, this article wouldn’t have been possible without his knowledge.
Many thanks also to Promit for his story about Mantle and Vulkan.
Aras from Unity, wrote an interesting blog post about Mantle and Vulkan.

**0.Preface: Why the Linux desktop never happened in the past**
One of the main reasons to have a computer is to play videogames or to work with them, we will get later about the jobs part but let’s discuss about why serious games aren’t on Linux.

_Why Linux doesn’t have AAA videogames?_<br>
Because game developers don’t compile them for Linux.

_Why gaming companies don’t package games for Linux?_<br>
Because the GPU drivers are underperformant and a mess.

_Why GPU drivers are a mess?_<br>
Because OpenGL is crippled beyond belief

_So it’s not Linux’s fault, but OpenGL, what happened?_<br>
You need an history lesson for this answer.

Our story begins during the 90s, the period of time when devices with the best graphics were the SNES and the Sega Genesis.

Note: Only Linux actually uses OpenGL, Sony for the PlayStation uses a modified version called PSGL running on a forked FreeBSD and the Xbox uses a modified DirectX. [this needs further revision, need to add other portable consoles]
