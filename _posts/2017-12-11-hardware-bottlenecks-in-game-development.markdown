In this blog post I will not talk about **obvious** hardware bottlenecks, like: a game consuming too much ram or being slow because your AI code is using all the CPU; but about some bottleneck problems that are obscure and strange to the average game developer that never worked on big projects where you need to squeeze the hardware to the last drop.

Draft ideas:

GPU
fill rate

CPU
draw calls
branch prediction
