title: How to build a quantum computer in D&D
---

*Warning Note*

I will try to explain quantum computers in the simplest way possible.
Everything explained here is in layman's terms, nothing is advanced math or physics and you don't even need to understand programming.

*The bit*

![Bit]({{site.baseurl}}/images/bit.png)

Every classical computer uses a binary system to encode information, 0 and 1.
During the beginning of 1900 there were prototypes working in ternary: 0,1 and 2 but as you can imagine they failed instantly;
there aren't real advantages and you need complex circuitry.
Binary systems became pretty widespread simply because it's easy to create them: vacuum tubes, transistors and so on; just turn the voltage on or off and you have a binary system.

*The quantum computer*

A quantum computer is just a computer that uses qubits instead of bits to encode information.

*The qubit*

So what is the qubit?
Well to put it simply a qubit is just a 3D bit.

A bit is 0 or 1, a point, a 0-dimensional bit.
A 1D bit is a point on a segment between 0 and 1
A 2D bit is a point on a circle
A 3D bit is a point a sphere!

Yes you can encode information as a point on a sphere!

*Hardware*

What do we use to build qubits (points on spheres)? 
The spin of elementary particles like electrons.
If you don't know what is a spin just imagine it as the north pole of its rotation. 
So quantum computers just use rows of single electrons encased in very small cages to encode information.
