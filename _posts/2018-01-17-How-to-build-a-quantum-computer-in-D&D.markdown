title: How to build a quantum computer in D&D
---

*Warning Note*

I will try to explain quantum computers in the simplest way possible!
Everything explained here is in layman's terms, nothing is advanced math and you don't even need to understand programming.

*The bit*

Every classical computer uses a binary system to encode information, 0 and 1.
During the beginning of 1900 there were prototypes working in ternary: 0,1 and 2 but as you can imagine they failed instantly;
there aren't real advantages and you need complex circuitry.
Binary systems became pretty widespread simply because it's easy to create them: vacuum tubes, transistors and so on; just turn the voltage on or off and you have a binary system.
